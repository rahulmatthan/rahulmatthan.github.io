      <title>Synthetic Biology</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While synthetic biology offers us many significant benefits, there is a risk that these benefits will accrue to the wealthy nations and corporations that currently control almost all cutting edge research in the field. To secure our interests we need to participate in global discussions on the subject. And increase our investments in the sector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The traditional approach to the digital transformation of governance has been to build full-stack solutions that are narrowly geared to addressing specific problems. This is highly inefficient and unless we commit to designing them so that they use shared, re-useable building blocks we are simply not going to achieve the outcomes we need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no doubt that AI will fundamentally change the ways in which films are made. But rather than worry about how this might affect the film-making process, we should embrace the change that is about to come and use it to think up new approaches to story-telling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All innovations build on those that came before. It is important to strike a balance between leveraging intellectual property protection for commercial benefit and stifling innovation in the process. And this is particularly relevant in the context of AI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Are We Willing to Change</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s new data protection law will require businesses to make significant changes to the ways in which they conduct their business. To the point where they will have to fundamentally re-imagine their ways of working. It is not clear to me that many of them understand the sheer magnitude of what that entails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DPI for Competition</title>
      <link>http://rahulmatthan.github.io/17/07/2024/dpi-for-competition/</link>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The draft Digital Competition Bill, 2024 is so heavily influenced by European regulation that it feels like yet another example of premature imitation. Which is strange considering that we can so easily leverage our DPI to deliver much more nuanced outcomes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One would have thought that digital technologies might have made this world a more inclusive place. As a matter of fact it has not. But there is a need for us to do better. A moral - and even economic - necessity to make this a more disabled friendly world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone agrees that there is an urgent need to reform many aspects of the judicial system. One way to do this might be to re-consider the reliance we currently place on oral advocacy and try and find an alternative way of doing things. Maybe even get rid of it entirely.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the fastest growing categories of AI services is artificial companions. Recent advances in large language models have significantly accelerated its proliferation. But as much as there are benefits to conversational engagement with artificial intelligence, there are psychological implications we will have to consider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artificial Intelligence has the potential to significantly enhance our digital public infrastructure by bringing variety to a DPI approach that has so far been optimised for standardisation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Controlling AI Export</title>
      <link>http://rahulmatthan.github.io/22/05/2024/controlling-ai-export/</link>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There has been growing concerns around the risks of open source AI. In the recent past these have begun to manifest themselves in the form of export restrictions on open source AI models - that could have a deleterious effect on India&amp;rsquo;s AI strategy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Open Source Governance</title>
      <link>http://rahulmatthan.github.io/08/05/2024/open-source-governance/</link>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a strange aversion in government circles to the use of open source software. I am no entirely sure where it comes from but I can try and debunk some of the misgivings they have. In most instances, releasing code as open source is actually a good idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ideas for Acceleration</title>
      <link>http://rahulmatthan.github.io/01/05/2024/ideas-for-acceleration/</link>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much of the reason why India has not yet achieved its full potential is because we simply have not invested in the institutional foundations of the Indian State. But, as Karthik Muralidharan describes in his authoratative book on the subject, there is reason to be optimistic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new paper from the Bank for International Settlements proposes the creation of a unified ledger and the tokenisation of everything. If it is successful, this could represent the most fundamental re-imagining of the banking system since the Medicis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting AI to Work for You</title>
      <link>http://rahulmatthan.github.io/17/04/2024/getting-ai-to-work-for-you/</link>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artificial intelligence might eventually replace us. But it still has a long way to go. In the meantime, rather than fretting about what might be, we should learn to use it so that we can make the most of all the efficiencies it offers. Here is how I do that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Age Tokens</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the more worrisome provisions of India&amp;rsquo;s new data protection law has to do with processing of children&amp;rsquo;s data - and in particular, how data fiduciaries should go about verifying the age of those whose data they process. Thanks to India&amp;rsquo;s digital public infrastructure, I believe we may have a novel solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A New Model for UPI</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the longest time, questions have been raised about the business model for UPI and how the industry should charge for its services. The government has prohibited MDR on UPI transactions, but it should still be possible for us to develop a new revenue model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>In Favour of DPI</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year there was widespread support for India&amp;rsquo;s DPI approach—with countries around the world hailing its achievements, and looking to emulate them. Over the past few months, however, the voices of dissent have grown steadily louder. Rather than allow arguments against DPI to go unanswered, I thought it best to deal with them head-on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cryptocurrency regulation has, so far, focussed on been on the mitigating the risk to speculative investors. But there is a far more important innovation that is embeded into the architecture and design of modern crypto currency. This is what regulators should be looking to better understand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We tend to resist change. We worry about the ways in which it could alter our existing way of life and the harms that could result as a consequence. But these technological changes almost always end up being nowhere near as frightening as they first seemed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advances in technology have transformed our societal interactions in ways that challenge the state&amp;rsquo;s monopoly over violence. Today large tech companies (not governments) determine how our interactions take place. Which means that we need to rethink governance structures if the state is to continue to protect its citizens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning from Failure</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need to encourage a culture of failure around AI so that when it fails we can understand why and disseminate those learnings throughout the industry. It is only when we can fail without fear that we will learn to do what it takes to build safe AI systems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone says we need to embrace renewable energy to address the challenges of climate change. But integrating variable supplies of electricity into our current grid is easier said than done. One way to do that might be to virtualise our power plants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PM-EAC suggests that AI should be regulated as a complex adaptive system. While there is a lot to say about this approach, in its articulation, the paper fails to take into account many of the essential features of modern AI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is widespread consternation around the impact that deep-fakes are going to have on all of society this year. But most legislative counter-measures are oriented towards shooting the messenger. We need a different path. Thankfully we have been here before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ODR approach can offer the soon-to-be-formed Data Protection Board mechanisms that are digital from the ground up. By integrating various elements of India’s digital public infrastructure into the ODR process adopted, we can ensure that data protection in India is techno-legal from the get-go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As we look to adopt techno-legal regulations in various different aspects of our technology driven world we need to be mindful of the need to retain a &amp;ldquo;zone of mischief&amp;rdquo; - a level of flexibility that will offer us the freedom to innovate and improve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The idea of micro-robots is about to make the transition from science fiction to science fact. But before we can take advantage of all that this new technology has to offer we will need to consider the various legal, ethical and societal concerns that this new technology can raise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the last week of 2023, the New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. The allegations in the complaint go to the core of how generative AI works and could shape the manner in which AI works going forward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2023 was the year in which DPI assumed its rightful place on the world stage. It was also the year in which artificial intelligence came into its own. There has never been a more interesting time to be engaged in technology policy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telecommunications Bill 2023 offers a radical new approach to telecom regulation. It replaces the license-based regime with a more legislative approach that can only be good for the sector. There is much that remains to be done to get this right but the law is a step in the right direction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The European Union has agreed to a new law to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) by imposing transparency requirements on general AI models and stronger restrictions on more powerful models. The US offers a broader, more nuanced framework. However there exists a North-South divide - with the Global South viewing AI as beneficial as contrasted to the more risk-focused approach of the Global North.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When man invented writing he enabled the creation of a hive-mind that eventually lead to the establishment of civilisation as we know it. The advent of large language models has exponentially expanded that hive-mind but has it done so at the cost of our humanity?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The events surrounding OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman highlight the challenges in establishing effective governance structures that can appropriately control AI development. Given the profit motivation of private enterprise and the other narrow commercial interests that they are constrained by, we need to develop alternate robust frameworks that can operate beyond the influence of private commercial entities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To ensure equitable access to digital public infrastructure, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to address the digital divide. This involves extending connectivity infrastructure globally, reimagining digital systems for offline accessibility, and enhancing digital literacy. Innovations like offline Aadhaar enrolment and QR-code-based services, along with user-friendly design, are key to making DPI inclusive and accessible to all, regardless of their technological proficiency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Given the similarities between the digital infrastructure that both Brazil and India have built it makes sense that as the new President of the G20, Brazil can build on all the work that India did during its Presidency to raise global attention to the concept of digital public infrastructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The myth of Pandora&amp;rsquo;s box, where opening a forbidden container unleashed the world&amp;rsquo;s evils but also hope, parallels scientific discovery. Each breakthrough, like CRISPR&amp;rsquo;s medical potential, brings unforeseen challenges, as seen with its controversial use in gene editing. Technologies intended for good, like the internet or drones, can be subverted for harm. Regulation alone can&amp;rsquo;t contain such knowledge; instead, we must design incentives to align technology use with societal goals, preparing us to handle the inevitable consequences of human curiosity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Brussels Effect&amp;rdquo; is the phenomenon where other countries adopt regulation similar to the EU&amp;rsquo;s and as a result ends up extending Europe&amp;rsquo;s regulatory dominance. However, regulations like the GDPR have faced criticism for its burdensome compliance requirements. India&amp;rsquo;s DPI approach offers a new data governance model. But in order for this approach to be globally successful, strong regulatory institutions and a commitment to techno-legal governance are necessary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a commonly held belief that there are basically three different approaches when it comes to data governance - the US, the Chinese and the European. But both the US and China leave regulation in the hands of technology companies - while the EU imposes regulations that these companies need to comply with. The middle path is the Indian techno-legal approach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite India&amp;rsquo;s success in pushing the DPI agenda during its Presidency of the G20 there have been some criticisms about the actual impact of its financial inclusion efforts. While there is no doubt that we are prone to embellishment, India&amp;rsquo;s achievements in the area are substantial. Criticisms about coercion are also unfounded given some level of market orchestration is necessary — especially in low and middle-income countries that are looking for accelerated development.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the number of extreme weather events that occurred in 2023, there is a new urgency around the need to find alternate and innovative solutions to the problem of climate change. One easy option is solar geo-engineering - that can be implemented by startups that raise donor funds to send up balloons carrying sulphates. That said this is not without its fair share of concerns. Not the least of which is uneven cooling and the impact on monsoon patterns in India.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Society&amp;rsquo;s response to disruptive technologies like AI follows a three-stage pattern: regulation, adaptation, and acceptance. Regulations tend to focus on first-order concerns, but overlook second-order consequences like the potential erosion of democratic values due to increased transparency of knowledge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As more and more of our transactions take place within environments that are digital from end-to-end, the easier it is for us to embed regulations directly into the code that these environments are made of. To do that we will need to build governance modules into our digital public infrastructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In an increasingly polarised world, the 2023 New Delhi Declaration at the Leaders Summit of the G20 was a diplomatic triumph.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rather than simply building DPI building blocks, countries that are looking to follow India’s DPI Approach should look to develop DPI solutions that leverage individual elements of the DPI stack in an interoperable manner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worldcoin has been designed to address the concern that in a world saturated with artificial intelligence we are going to need a proof of humanness. As true as that might be, I believe we need to go much further. And also tackle truth in content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 is not perfect. There are many things I would have liked to change. But it has been enacted and it is the law we’ve been given.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s new data protection law is simple and principle based. But it will require companies big and small to make radical changes to the way they operate. And I don&amp;rsquo;t think businesses fully realise the changes they are going to have to make.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The practice of infecting human subjects with disease under controlled circumstances to better understand how the body reacts to a new treatment is as old as medical science itself. The reason why it is not common in India is because of ethical and legal concerns. If we can find our way past that this could be a useful approach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Large language models require training data sets in order to continuously improve. However, given the rate at which models are growing we are soon going to run out of training data. And synthetic data is not the solution we thought it might be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Digital Personal Data Protection Bill - that has been listed as one of the items for discussion in the Monsoon Session of Parliament - will, if enacted be a significant first step in the journey to a functional privacy regime. But there is still a lot to be done including issuing regulations and establishing the Data Protection Board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regulating the intersection of data protection and competition is hard. Dominant platforms can leverage user data to create monopolies, limit user choice and raise competition concerns. As India prepares its own data protection law, it should try and avoid regulatory overlaps and strike a balance between data protection and competition regulation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We tend to think of technology as either “good” nor “bad” based on the outcomes it has. This is futile as in most instances any harms that may be caused by technology is on account of how it is used and by whom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Technologies require regulators to think innovatively about safety. To find a way to encourage experimentation and yet not do so at the cost of human safety. This is a difficult line to draw but draw it we must.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As artificial intelligence enters into the music industry, incumbents have already begun to resist the transformation it will inevitably bring. But change is inevitable and it is only those artists who are able to embrace it who will survive the transition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our instinctive reaction to new and revolutionary technology is often fear of consequences that we cannot predict. But if we can rein in our instincts and conquer our fears, maybe we can master of the technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve embraced technology when it comes to urban transport leveraging ride hailing applications for personal transport as well as the delivery of packages of all sorts right to our doorstep. And yet, our national road transport system is surprisingly analog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have, for most of our existence as a nation, accepted the governance frameworks that have already been implemented elsewhere in the world. With digital public infrastructure India is, perhaps for the first time, making the rules. It is time for us to stop being rule-takers and assume the role of rule-makers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regulators believe that the moment a new technology comes around they need to flex their regulatory muscle to wrestle it under control. In most instances they would be far better off waiting till they fully understand all the dimensions of the problem before acting. The new CERT-In advisory on generative AI is a case in point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content moderation challenges arise from the vast volume of online content and diverse user beliefs. Current moderation uses automated tools and human moderators, but both have flaws. Evelyn Douek suggests a &amp;ldquo;systems thinking&amp;rdquo; approach, focusing on systemic solutions rather than individual errors. As India drafts the Digital India Act, a shift towards addressing systemic issues in content moderation is essential.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) has significantly increased bank account ownership since 2014, with 56% of these accounts owned by women, reducing the gender gap. However, most women use these accounts only for benefit transfers, not for savings or financial products. To enhance women&amp;rsquo;s financial engagement, promoting digital payments and designing services tailored to women&amp;rsquo;s needs, considering their unique challenges, is essential. Proper training and fostering a supportive ecosystem are crucial for genuine financial inclusion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent discussions on AI regulation often focus on privacy concerns, especially in relation to the GDPR. Large Language Models (LLMs) can conflict with GDPR principles like consent, data minimization, and retention. Conversational AI&amp;rsquo;s potential to store personal data raises further concerns. However, instead of constraining AI within outdated laws, regulatory frameworks should evolve to accommodate and enable new technologies, balancing innovation with privacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While AI will transform society and make certain jobs obsolete, it will also create new opportunities. Different countries have proposed varied regulatory approaches, from the US&amp;rsquo;s hands-off stance to the EU&amp;rsquo;s detailed guidelines. The UK&amp;rsquo;s agile, principle-based approach, which adapts based on experience and avoids rigid legislation, is recommended for India to harness AI&amp;rsquo;s potential without stifling innovation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data governance faces challenges in enforcement due to businesses seeking ways around regulations to maximise data usage. Traditional laws are often outpaced by evolving business practices. The &amp;ldquo;Privacy by Design&amp;rdquo; concept embeds privacy into technology design, but its success depends on businesses&amp;rsquo; willingness to adopt it. India&amp;rsquo;s techno-legal approach, emphasising interoperability, federation, and protocol-based design in its digital public infrastructure, offers a model for embedding regulatory principles directly into technology, ensuring more effective data governance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent advancements in AI, including upgrades in large language models and image generation, have showcased immense potential. However, odd behaviors in these systems, like Bing&amp;rsquo;s alter ego &amp;ldquo;Sydney&amp;rdquo; and eerie image generations in Stable Diffusion, raise concerns about machine super-intelligence. Nick Bostrom&amp;rsquo;s warnings about unregulated AI development emphasize the need for industry guardrails to ensure safe AI evolution and prevent uncontrollable advancements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s digital public infrastructure has transformed daily life, with UPI processing billions of transactions monthly. However, global innovations, like mPESA in Kenya and DCash in the Eastern Caribbean, highlight the worldwide growth of DPI. At a recent knowledge-sharing event, global participants recognized India&amp;rsquo;s leadership in DPI and sought guidance on its design and governance. India&amp;rsquo;s experience positions it to guide other nations in developing robust digital ecosystems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and the tokenization of private money deposits could revolutionize the financial system. Agustin Carstens suggests a unified digital ledger for both public and private digital money, enabling efficiencies like smart contracts and instant settlements. This approach could extend to tokenizing various assets, transforming governance by embedding compliance within transactions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the early internet era, websites were liable for third-party content, leading to legal challenges. US Section 230 was introduced, protecting online platforms from being treated as publishers for user-generated content. However, in Gonzales vs. Google, YouTube&amp;rsquo;s recommendation algorithms are under scrutiny, potentially redefining Section 230&amp;rsquo;s protections. The decision could reshape online content moderation globally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Generative AI has had a transformative impact on text and visual arts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digi Yatra, India&amp;rsquo;s new biometric air travel system, adequately addresses privacy concerns. It is designed to keep personal data on the user&amp;rsquo;s device and purge data from airport systems 24 hours post-flight. Despite my initial skepticism, the system is efficient and privacy-conscious.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are concerns over India&amp;rsquo;s digital public infrastructure and the role of self-regulatory organizations like the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). In particular that these entities, lacking oversight, could become &amp;ldquo;Alt Big Tech,&amp;rdquo; potentially harming users and stifling innovation. While these organizations are privately operated, function under regulatory supervision and could represent a new model for governing modern techno-legal ecosystems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The transformative potential of OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s ChatGPT is like how Google revolutionised search. ChatGPT could disrupt the targeted advertising model that sustains most internet businesses by providing summarized information instead of directing users to specific websites. The technology&amp;rsquo;s potential to change the internet&amp;rsquo;s fundamental business model is emphasized.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A reflection on the tech policy developments in India during 2022. While my initial predictions about data protection laws and tech sector reforms didn&amp;rsquo;t unfold as expected, there have been positive strides in India&amp;rsquo;s digital public infrastructure, like the UPI payment system and Account Aggregator ecosystem. India&amp;rsquo;s upcoming G20 presidency could further spotlight its techno-legal approach to regulation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are two types of entrepreneurs: &amp;ldquo;Idea Factories,&amp;rdquo; who generate numerous ideas but struggle with execution, and &amp;ldquo;Factories for Ideas,&amp;rdquo; who excel at turning a single idea into a successful business. Recognizing whether an entrepreneur falls into one or the other of these types can help advice them appropriately - and ideally entrepreneurial teams should pair both types for optimal success.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Education is evolving in the age of technology and AI. While modern education is moving away from rote learning to skills like critical thinking, students should also be trained to use AI as a research tool. However, the rise of AI-generated content poses challenges in distinguishing genuine research from fabricated material, necessitating the teaching of healthy skepticism and cross-referencing skills to students.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need to think about creating &amp;ldquo;sufficiently decentralized&amp;rdquo; social networks. While decentralization offers more control to users, it has drawbacks - such as non-unique usernames across the network. If we can use smart contracts to create a decentralized name registry we might be able to balance user control and functionality, and create a more user-empowered internet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s new draft data protection law mandates that data fiduciaries must notify affected individuals and the Data Protection Board of a breach, but it lacks specifics as to timelines or remedial actions. I worry that over-reporting minor incidents could lead to public desensitization, and would have preferred a more balanced approach that only requires notification of only the most high-risk breaches, similar to the European GDPR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new draft of India&amp;rsquo;s digital data protection bill is praised for its simplicity and relatability, although it has raised concerns for its lack of detail and government exemptions. The draft also misses key concepts like data portability and uses non-standard terminology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The latest draft of India&amp;rsquo;s Digital Data Protection Bill, 2022, stands out for its simplicity and new concepts like &amp;ldquo;voluntary undertaking&amp;rdquo; and official recognition of &amp;ldquo;consent managers.&amp;rdquo; However, it omits features like data portability and the right to be forgotten. Critics argue the draft lacks safeguards and over-delegates legislative authority, particularly around the concept of &amp;ldquo;deemed consent.&amp;rdquo; But the principles-based approach it espouses could ensure agile and enduring data protection regulation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elon Musk&amp;rsquo;s takeover of Twitter has reignited debates on content moderation and free speech. But today it is not content that is the challenge but context. We need to move from centralized platforms to federated, protocol-based networks, allowing user-controlled, context-sensitive conversations. This is a model already successful in India&amp;rsquo;s digital public infrastructure. digital public infrastructure content moderation context data governance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As India prepares for its G20 presidency, the focus on its Digital Public Infrastructure gains momentum. India&amp;rsquo;s DPI, built on open, interoperable principles, offers a new approach to data governance that benefits both developing and developed economies. It aims for equitable data use, empowering individuals and enabling market innovation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ethanol, a fuel that emits 44%–52% less greenhouse gas than petrol, is presented as a viable step towards sustainability for India, a major sugar producer like Brazil. By adopting flex-fuel technology and ethanol production techniques, India could significantly reduce CO2 emissions without immediate radical changes to its energy infrastructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI is being increasingly used in journalism and law. OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT-3, can produce content nearly indistinguishable from human-written work. But we need to remember that AI is a tool, not a substitute for human creativity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information Technology Act, 2000 governs cyber incidents and data protection in India. A recent amendment permits certain negotiable instruments and real estate contracts to be executed digitally.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data asymmetry allows those with access to large data sets to gain insights that can be used for various purposes, including manipulation. Solutions like India&amp;rsquo;s DEPA framework aim to reduce this asymmetry. However, challenges remain in knowledge and intelligence asymmetry, requiring democratisation of data science techniques and addressing biases in AI algorithms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Department of Telecommunications has released a draft bill to replace the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885, aiming to reimagine the regulation of the telecom sector in India. The draft includes provisions for the government&amp;rsquo;s exclusive privilege to provide telecommunication services. It also brings obligations from license agreements into the statute, requiring parliamentary approval for amendments. The draft has been criticized for its broad definition of &amp;ldquo;telecommunication services,&amp;rdquo; potentially affecting over-the-top (OTT) services, and for loosely defined terms that could create loopholes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Given the Indian government&amp;rsquo;s increased use of technology, concerns around personal privacy necessitate the conduct of privacy impact assessments and the implementation of appropriate safeguards, such as a government privacy office, to balance the benefits of the technology with the potential harms to privacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the 1600s, scientists collaborated more openly in physics but in secrecy in the field of alchemy. This is probably why physics has continued to this day while alchemy is a dead science. This is why we need open access in modern technology. Shared innovation fosters progress, while secrecy leads to stagnation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DOT is looking to revamp the Indian Telegraph Act to upgrade it to a modern law. If we had a blank slate to reimagine the law what would it look like. I suggest that we do away with the license regime and put all the regulations into the law. This way services providers just sign up a single document signifying that they are bound by the law and the regulations. Then we should simplify the entire system by simply dividing all telecom services into either carriage or access services and prescribing obligations in that manner. Lets make it technology neutral - especially when it comes to distinctions between voice and data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PM-EAC has recommended reforms to India&amp;rsquo;s patent system that primarily involved ramping up the work force (from about 800 to 2800 in a couple of years) and also introducing the utility system of patents as appropriate. I suggest we go a bit further and try and tweak the term of patent so that it is more appropriate for the invention being protected. So 20 years for pharma but no more than 5 for tech patents that in any event evolve to the next generation within that time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are parallels between the myth of the Tower of Babel and the modern linguistic challenge of the internet. In this India has a unique need for translation technology, given its linguistic diversity. Bhashini may be the answer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intellectual property boundaries are being streteched with companies claiming exclusive rights over specific colors and the extension of copyright terms.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a parallel between the use of barbed wire in the American prairies to establish property rights and the modern challenge of protecting intangible assets like intellectual property. Barbed wire allowed landowners to enforce title by fencing off land instead of branding ownership onto cattle. Decentralized technologies, such as blockchain, could transform the way intangible assets are protected, just like erecting fences around real estate, made it inherently resistant to trespass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>There are many benefits that can be derived from space investments - including communication satellites, GPS technology, weather prediction, and various innovations. We need broad-based participation in the space sector, including private investments and to this end the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) is a positive step.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need to understand how Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) fit into the modern 2-tiered banking system. While CBDCs offer potential benefits, such as banking the unbanked, do we even need a CBDC in the Indian context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need technological disruption in India&amp;rsquo;s legal system. I believe this would reqire us to maximise the potential of online dispute resolution (ODR). The upcoming GST Appellate Tribunal could be a unique opportunity to leverage ODR, transforming the legal profession through efficiency and accessibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The US Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Medical overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the guaranteed right to abortion since 1973. The ruling challenges decades of jurisprudence, threatens civil liberties, and impacts personal privacy. It also raises questions about the doctrine of stare decisis and the frailty of judge-made law.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We believe that internet platforms are too dominant to fail. But this is not true when you think of the evolution of internet search and curation - suggesting that technology evolves in cycles. We may be on the cusp of a major cyclical transformation - in which case we may challenge the notion that Big Tech is too big to fail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In 2014, India’s ministry of law and justice issued a policy on pre-legislative consultation, partially drawing on OECD recommendations. While most legislative proposals in India set aside time for public comments, the consultation often appears to be a formality. We need to redesign the process so that stakeholders can approach the process constructively - recognizing that policy-making is a compromise, and that both government and stakeholders must be open to differing viewpoints.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a reaction to the industrialization of agriculture, particularly the disproportionate land use for livestock, there is growing interest in plant-based meat alternatives. However, even these innovations may have unforeseen consequences, such as deforestation due to increased soy demand. Scientific advancements often solve problems while simultaneously creating new ones, challenging ethical norms and leading to continuous cycles of innovation and adaptation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In India, the absence of comprehensive privacy law has led to over-reliance on CERT-In Rules, 2013, for data breach guidance. Recent directions by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has expanded mandatory reporting requirements, raising concerns about inundating CERT-In with trivial incidents and, as a result, hindering its ability to respond to serious breaches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a crisis of context in modern information consumption. While data is abundant, understanding its significance requires context. And context is scarce.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I support India&amp;rsquo;s new draft battery-swapping policy for electric vehicles, particularly since it promotes battery-as-a-service and emphasizes openness without being overly prescriptive. However, we should aspire to lead in developing standards that align with its market, leveraging its position as the world&amp;rsquo;s largest two-wheeler market, and its expertise in the EV sector, to assume global leadership in battery swapping standards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Perry Barlow&amp;rsquo;s 1996 &amp;ldquo;A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace&amp;rdquo; argued for internet exceptionalism, where the online world would be free from real-world regulations. This belief shaped the liberal terms of service on websites, but with the internet&amp;rsquo;s growth and concentration in the hands of dominant platforms, the enforcement of these terms has led to serious global consequences. Barlow&amp;rsquo;s vision of a more humane online civilization may have been overly optimistic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;European negotiators have agreed on the Digital Markets Act, a law aimed at regulating dominant platforms in Europe. A key focus appears to be interoperability, particularly among messaging platforms. While it is intended to increase competition, mandatory interoperability may degrade privacy and create conflicts with global technology platforms&amp;rsquo; policies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are divergent approaches to data regulation across the US, China, and Europe. The US has a laissez-faire approach, China tends to be oriented towards state-centric control, and Europe is overtly rights-based. The growing schisms between these approaches are causing fragmentation, leading to a call for a common ground in global data governance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Francis Fukuyama coined the term &amp;ldquo;vetocracy&amp;rdquo; to describe a gridlocked decision-making system where individuals can prevent policy implementation through vetoes. But while the physical world may suffer from excessive vetocracy, the digital sphere often leans towards autocracy. We need a balance between these two extremes and that is even more important in the context of India&amp;rsquo;s digital infrastructure. Vetocratic processes can be used to protect core principles, while maintaining flexibility to foster innovation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s struggle to decipher a convoluted legal order highlights a broader issue of intentional incomprehensibility in legal language. This complexity often makes laws inaccessible to laypersons. We need plain language reforms, comprehensive lists of laws, explainers for every law, and measures to ease the compliance burdens if we are to make the legal systems more accessible and democratic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone I know has a story about how their phone is spying on them. This usually has to do with how they started seeing ads in their news feed that pertain to something that they said or did offline that was somehow being picked up by our devices and used to target advertising at us. But if you think about it there is no way in which telephone companies can do that - or will even want to. It costs too much and is not worth the effort. What seems like personalised surveillance always has another explanation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The design of digital data sharing infrastructure must be federated. Where there is a need for data availability beyond the duration that data fiduciaries will retain it we need to build data storage alternatives that data principals can use. We should resist the temptation of getting the government to build these data stores as a public good because the role of the government is to govern - and it should not get into the business of data storage and data management. Instead we should take a market approach and encourage private data storage providers to offer federated, inter-operable solutions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An analysis of the JPCs draft of the data protection bill has some welcome changes - the amendments to children&amp;rsquo;s data and the introduction of Section 62 that allows complaints to be filed. It also has some misguided changes such as the introduction of NGOs in the definitions. It also has changes that will have a significant impact such as the amendments to Section 35 and 36 on exemptions to law enforcement. Finally it introduces some new concepts that are problematic such as the requirement that data protection officers in companies need to be senior officials and the inclusion of non-personal data within the ambit of the law.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a growing recognition of the fact that we can use technology tools to make our regulations smarter. There are 2 categories of tools to do this. The first gives users more control over what can be done with their data by placing data in pods and only allowing them to be accessed in accordance with the privacy management protocols. The second unlocks data silos allowing data to move between them with the consent of the user. While these tools seem contradictory they operate at opposite ends of the data spectrum can can be combined to augment statutory frameworks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cryptocurrency regulation will have to address a number of issues. To address the fact that cryptocurrencies provide anonymity, regulations can ensure that crypto exchanges conduct customer verification checks and be trained on anti-money laundering. The exchanges themselves can be required to be registered in India to fall within the ambit of Indian law. To address taxation concerns, our laws can be amended to base the tax payable on the fair market value of cryptocurrency as on the date of payment or receipt. Any offers of cryptocurrency can be required to comply with disclosure requirements for investor protection. All this can be achieved by amending existing laws and does not need a new regulation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bacteriophages target specific bacterial cells and destroy them leaving all other cells unharmed. These organisms have been used for phage therapy - a treatment for disease that involves administering the specific bacteriophage corresponding to a given bacterial infection in order to treat it. Now that the continuous use of broad spectrum antibiotics has resulted in superbugs with high levels of antibiotic resistance, phage therapy might be the precision medicine solution that we need. This will require us to overhaul our current thinking about pharmaceuticals and adopt more localised manufacture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fictional science of psychohistory is predicated on the proposition that while human behaviour is erratic in isolation, when aggregated to population scale it becomes predictable. Today we use big data to predict customer behaviour and third wave economics uses real-time data to solve real world problems. In time this will allow us to understand the steps we need to take to shape desirable outcomes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When there were limited uses to which data could be put, it was easy to evaluate the harms that could result from providing consent. Things are much more complex today so data protection regulations have tried to improve the quality of consent. This has resulted in the transparency paradox. If we can adopt consent templates we can give users appropriate autonomy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every evolution of communications technology from the printing press to the telegraph to telephones and eventually the internet has placed new and different stresses on personal privacy. As much as we welcome these technologies when launched,  in time we realise the effect that they can have on personal privacy. The whole point of communicating is to violate your privacy in a controlled way. But if we do not have information about all the ways in which a given communication can affect your privacy you cannot really exercise effective control over it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The South African patent office has granted a patent to an artificial intelligence program for an invention it has made. India granted a copyright to an AI application along similar lines. It is not clear how an artificial intelligence can exercise the IP granted by prosecuting a breach or negotiating commercial arrangements for its license. All these actions will have to be taken by humans on behalf of the AI in which case what is the point in calling the algorithm an inventor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Identity is a prerequisite for the provision of services and efficient identity systems are necessary to scale digital public infrastructure. We can build back trust in identity systems through encryption and tokenisation of identity information by using privacy preserving technologies like zero knowledge proofs so that we can still establish eligibility for a service without exposing identity information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reason why email is the most widely used messaging protocol is because it uses an open interoperable protocol that allows messages to be exchanged freely regardless of the underlying operating system. If we are to take advantage of the benefits of data we need to enable open interoperable protocols that will break down the silos of our digital infrastructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cutting edge of innovation in NFTs is taking place in the gaming space. Most NFT based games use non-fungible tokens to attest the title of in-game digital assets. If we start to use the metaverse for more and more real world activities, we will need some way to assert title over digital assets. NFT&amp;rsquo;s could become the future of title in the metaverse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to extract greater efficiency out of existing systems we sometimes need to break the atomic units of those systems down into even smaller pieces so that we can re-imagine how they can be put back together. This is the sort of unbundling that we need to do of the retail stack in order to be able to build a digital retail infrastructure that can empower our small traders. This is the only way we can enable hyperlocal commerce at national scale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The courts in the US have upheld the App Store model arguing that it demonstrates pro-competitive features that outweigh concerns of monopolistic activity. All it does is prevent operators of these stores from putting in place measures that ensure that all in-app transactions be routed exclusively through the App Store so the fees can be deducted at source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A number of countries have realised that they need to extend their data protection frameworks through new measures that will unlock data silos in order to make it easier for data to flow from one entity to another with the permission of the data subject. However, if these measures are adopted solely through legislation they will fail. Technology businesses must be regulated through a mixture of law and technology - strong principle based laws and protocol based technology guardrails to ensure compliance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Policy-making requires an understanding of the reciprocal relationships inherent in regulation. Focusing on a policy outcome in a narrow area of specific intent will result in unintended consequences in reciprocally related areas. In these instances it is important to think about policy making as a dial. Tilting too much in one direction will cause harm elsewhere. It is about finding the right balance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The proliferation of micro-entrepreneurs in India has been enabled by India&amp;rsquo;s radically unbundled e-commerce ecosystem. However, given the expansive wording of the new Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, the flourishing of this important ecosystem is threatened as the platforms enabling these entrepreneurs will have to comply with so many obligations as to make their operations commercially infeasible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The technology to create the metaverse is at the stage where it could well become a reality. However, unlike the internet that was created by patient capital, the metaverse will be created by big tech. We need to develop open standards and regulations so that we can ensure that there are no walled gardens in the metaverse. India has already built interoperable infrastructure to address essential aspects of the metaverse like payments. It has the opportunity to be a leader in its development.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the one hand the internet is so good at remembering things that we have to create legal frameworks to force it to forget. On the other hand, in those instances where we expect the internet to remember things in the same way we used to rely on libraries link-rot and content-drift has resulted in valuable information no longer being traceable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DEPA framework encodes most of the privacy principles that run through most privacy regulations into the framework of data transfers. However, while it solves the questions of notice, consent and purpose limitation, once the data is in the possession of the transferee, the traditional DEPA framework has no control over what is subsequently done with it. This means that it will no address issues of use restriction, data minimisation and retention limitation. If we can integrate into the traditional DEPA framework the concept of Confidential Clean Rooms we should be able to address these remaining privacy principles as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By repealing the drones regulations it passed just 4 months previously the government has demonstrated that it is willing to listen to public feedback and promote a more business friendly regulatory framework. What is critical is for the new regulations to carefully define the airspace map for drone operations and to remove the penal consequences that the new framework has imposed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pandemic forced us into a natural experiment that has given us valuable insights about the natural world in the absence of humans. It also allowed us to experiment with changing various regulations to continue to operate in a lockdown. We should use the learnings from this natural experiment to figure out how to implement empirical policy-making by implementing regulatory sandboxes for our policy endeavours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breakthroughs in science require patient capital that must be provided by the government. Scientists need to be given a long rope and not be held to the standards of accountability to which we typically hold the government. They need to have bipartisan [[political support]] as they operate at time-scales beyond that which politicians normally function within. They need pipelines to market that will allow these ideas to be naturally commercialised.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We will need to find a way to allow everyone the flexibility to work from home when they want yet still be able to benefit from working collaboratively with their colleagues in the ways that we only know to make possible in office. This will call for rethinking meetings so that it works just as well with a mixture of in-person and dial in participants. We will need to re-think network security to account for people calling in from everywhere and not just from behind the office firewall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Intermediary Guidelines 2021 just make things more confused. It will cover social media intermediaries on the basis of registered users and not active users which can be a big deal for many companies that have a relatively small active Indian user base. It will apply to services that provide messaging as just an ancillary service - and most digital platforms do that. Voluntary verification is also a strange requirement since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t ensure traceability because its not mandatory. Anyone who fails to comply even with the most minor requirements of the regulations will lose their intermediary liability protections.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need different protocols to deal with the pandemic in rural India. Instead of supplying oxygen we need to provide them with a supply of medicines and basic equipment they need. Since it is not feasible to get RTPCR tests done in a reasonable time frame we need to replace that with syndromic testing using oximeters and thermometers. And we need to leverage our decentralised healthcare networks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The concept of a sovereign nation-state grew out of the Treaty of Westphalia that established the absolute authority of a sovereign power over its territory. Technology compresses distances and helped improve control over the far flung regions of nation-states. The internet compressed distances even more. This coupled with globalisation has challenged the concept of sovereignty. Nations have opposed this with data localisation laws and slowly big tech companies are agreeing to be bound by concepts of regional sovereignty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We must combat vaccine hesitancy and get everyone vaccinated against covid-19. The only strategy to survive in India is to not get infected or to get fully vaccinated. The risk of blood clots is insignificant compared to the risk of getting the disease.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to effect the judicial sector reforms that has been outlined in the Digital Courts Vision document, we need to unbundle the workflows in the judicial system and reduce them down to their constituent parts. We should then focus on the outcomes we are looking to achieve and re-assemble them using re-usable building blocks from existing stack infrastructure. Since much of the digitisation of the judicial sector can be expressed in terms of data flows we can achieve this by borrowing from the design of DEPA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NFTs are digital tokens that represent ownership in an underlying asset. At present they are a means by which to monetise digital art but eventually they will become the digital bridge that various commercial applications need for monetisation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://rahulmatthan.github.io/30/03/2021/overlap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Issues of privacy and competition often overlap and we need a coordinated approach between regulators. That works in the US and EU where both the privacy and the competition regulators are active. In India, where we are yet to establish a privacy regulator, the competition commission will step in and regulate privacy aspects of data businesses from a competition perspective. There is a risk that privacy will be decided from a competition perspective. We need a data protection authority asap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When measures being put in place to prevent third-party cookies from tracking individuals across the internet, companies that relied on these cookies to deliver personalised services had to find workarounds. Privacy activists are concerned that all this does is concentrate power in the hands of fewer gatekeepers. We can use this opportunity to move away from advertising as the business model for the internet and explore the subscription model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new map guidelines issued by the government has liberalised the map making in the country by doing away with the requirement for prior approvals and security clearances, relying instead on companies to self-certify their compliance. It has legalised the export of maps up to 1 meter resolution and have permitted Indian companies to use drones, street view and LiDAR technologies to create maps of higher resolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin should not be treated as a currency. But at the same time it should not be banned. Cryptocurrencies are permissionless systems that operate without intermediaries. As a result central banks cannot implement macro-economic measures in the event of a financial crisis. However, they are programable and can be incorporated into smart contracts offering a number of opportunities for digital financial inclusion. CBDCs are the best of both worlds combining the programability of bitcoin with the stability of fiat currency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nowhere in the world have age verification obligations been imposed on online services like in India&amp;rsquo;s data protection law. Requiring users to prove their identity before the link they have clicked on can open will break the internet. Requiring children to get parental consent is not necessarily a good thing as parents often have a lesser understanding of privacy risk than their children who are digital natives. Instead we should hold platforms accountable for harms caused to children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian Intermediary Guidelines require messaging services to be able to identify the first originator of information. For those services that are end-to-end encrypted complying with this obligation will mean that they can no longer guarantee the anonymity of the parties. By asking message originators to be identified, it requires every single message to be tracked. In trying to identify a few criminals, it makes criminals of us all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Australia&amp;rsquo;s media bargaining law that requires digital platforms to share revenues with Australian news companies only allows companies that deal in core news to enter into these revenue-share agreements. This excludes smaller publications and those that provide non-news content. Digital platforms decoupled content from distribution allowing small content providers to reach larger audiences. The Australian legislation will reverse this trend by supporting big new at the cost of independent content providers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Competition Commission of India has argued that since privacy is a non-price factor of competition, the competition regulator can regulate it. Privacy is a specialised area that should not be entrusted to a regulator that brings a purely economic lens its regulation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regulation can never keep up with technology. What we need to do is develop principles-based regulation and allow regulators discretion in its implementation through effective post-facto enforcement. We should presume that regulatory actions have been taken in good faith unless proven otherwise and build transparency into our systems to ensure that regulators do not exceed their authority. Regulators should list all applicable regulations on their website and not attempt to enforce anything outside those regulations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In India, electronic records can only be brought into evidence if accompanied by a certificate signed by a responsible person describing how it was produced and details of the computer involved in its production. Unless we remove these offline measures and replace them with digital certificates and other forms of electronic authentication, digital dispute resolution will be crippled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We gave internet companies immunity for the content the flows through their pipes because communication infrastructure should have no opinion on the content. This, however does not solve the problem of offensive content - at best it passes the buck. We need a framework for determining what is acceptable speech. Governments should develop prohibited content dashboards so that internet companies can understand clearly what content is permissible and what is not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data is not the new oil. It is infinite and unconstrained by geography. It is not destroyed when it is consumed and can be used simultaneously or repeatedly without degradation in quality. Countries should not try to regulate data like they regulate oil - by bringing it under their physical control. They should not only try and force big tech to share the datasets they have created, but also make the effort to learn what it takes to build datasets of our own—and then go about building them relevant to our context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just as data can be used to democratise credit, these technologies are easily misused. Today [[digital lending]] companies prey on the poor by offering high interest loans to advertising targetted to popup when they are vulnerable. Regulating this will call for coordination between the telecom department (for anti-spam regulations) and MeITy to regulate (in-app advertising).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My reflections on my 2020 predictions about technological advancements. The pandemic emphasized technology&amp;rsquo;s central role in society, from remote working to vaccine development. New regulatory measures give hope for increased internet access and technology legislation in India, recognizing the need to adapt and engage with technology in new ways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cost of KYC is an impediment to lending below a certain ticket size. If we can permit lenders to use [[Derived KYC]] ensuring that it is only deployed in a digital context with all the required guardrails we will be able to radically reduce the cost of KYC opening up lending to the masses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It wasn’t long before I realised that as a technology, it flattered to deceive. I would be far better served investing in consciously building a personal knowledge management system that help me synthesise all the various elements of knowledge I came across so that I was able to surface hidden connections.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The transition from owning things to subscribing to things is going to be hard until there is widespread market adoption and greater choice. Consumption is central to our economy and the only way we know to consume is by owning things. However once digital distribution becomes seamless we can subscribe to whatever we need to consume whenever we need them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

His family has discovered an experimental therapy that skips the missing exon in the DMD gene, allowing dystrophin production. Despite bureaucratic obstacles, the Central Licensing Authority permitted a clinical trial across India.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If we are to take a comprehensive approach to tech sector regulation, we need to identify core regulatory objectives, establish regulatory principles, and involving experts in the regulatory process. We need agile governance that encourages multi-stakeholder participation, and allows for the creation of self-regulatory organizations (SROs). We should also establish technical standards organizations (TSOs) to continuously update and maintain digital public infrastructure standards, ensuring their relevance and effectiveness in the rapidly changing tech landscape.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture framework allows data companies to collect consent for data portability just before transfer, simplifying privacy policies and focusing them on data collection and use. This unbundling of consent improves user control over personal data and enhances privacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ford&amp;rsquo;s internal combustion engine car beat Edison&amp;rsquo;s EV to the market and as a result we are on our current fossil fuel dependent path.

Few Shot Learning is an alternative to data guzzling artificial intelligence models that allows us to not be dependent on large datasets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having multiple NPCI entities would be expensive and insecure. There is no benefit building multiple clearing and settlement centres. Its better to ensure that NPCI is neutral and redundant. We should build a separate standards setting body so that regulators can focus on running the system while the standards body can setting and maintain standards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The internet has evolved from Sir Tim Berners-Lee&amp;rsquo;s original open vision to the current centralized platforms. It is important to promote decentralization and the Beckn protocol is an ambitious project aimed at creating an open, interoperable alternative to eCommerce platforms. Beckn&amp;rsquo;s success could revolutionize digital commerce, particularly in India, by allowing businesses to interact directly without platform intermediaries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Digital Health Mission&amp;rsquo;s Strategy Overview outlines India&amp;rsquo;s plan to become a Digital Health Nation, leveraging the nascent state of healthcare digitization to learn from other countries and avoid their mistakes. The strategy involves adapting India&amp;rsquo;s data portability architecture, using the Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) for healthcare data sharing. It proposes a radically-federated design, storing healthcare data at its generation point and enabling rapid data transfer across the health system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is considering reviving a proposal to limit transactions per entity in the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) ecosystem to prevent market dominance by a few players. Currently, three major players dominate the market, with two accounting for 77% of transactions. The NPCI aims to mitigate systemic risks and promote competition. There are alternative measures like leveling the playing field, regulating data control, and allowing more participants, rather than imposing transaction limits, to ensure a diverse and competitive UPI ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first draft report of India&amp;rsquo;s Non-Personal Data Committee suggests democratizing data and introducing a new category of data principal - the community. However, absent guidelines for data trusts, the potential risks of politicization and favoritism within community action groups could result in potential misuse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The article &amp;ldquo;The Right to Privacy&amp;rdquo; by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis, published in 1890, has been influential in shaping modern privacy law. This foundational work has indirectly contributed to securing protections for the LGBTQ+ community, including influencing decisions that decriminalized homosexuality in the U.S. and India. But recent scholarship suggests that Warren&amp;rsquo;s motivation for writing the article may not have been what we thought it was.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pandemic&amp;rsquo;s shift to online education highlights social inequities, as not all students have equal internet access. Asynchronous learning, unlike the current synchronous virtual classrooms, offers a solution by allowing students to learn at their own pace and access materials offline, potentially making education more inclusive and adaptable to individual needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In 2011, a biology book was listed on Amazon for $1.7 million, eventually reaching $23 million due to two sellers&amp;rsquo; algorithms reacting to each other&amp;rsquo;s pricing. This incident underscores the challenges and potential regulatory issues as businesses increasingly rely on algorithms. It has gained attention in legal contexts, including Indian courts, where cases challenge the legality of pricing algorithms used by ride-hailing companies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As countries grapple with COVID-19&amp;rsquo;s community spread phase, the focus has shifted to frequent testing. It is time to consider the potential use of health and immunity passports. These passports could become essential for travel and social activities, but at the same time give rise to a greater risk of deepening social divides and creating new forms of privilege.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Covid forced courts to adapt to remote working. And they did remarkably well considering the extent to which court processes rely on physical interactions. We need to use this opportunity to radically re-imagine dispute resolution. We can move to written advocacy, use artificial intelligence to make better decisions about litigation strategy - such as the chance of success of an appeal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of global supply chains and our over-reliance on just-in-time delivery models. While some may argue for more insular approaches and increased governmental control, the free movement of data and international collaboration has enabled rapid responses, such as genome sequencing and 3D printing of medical equipment. The crisis highlights the potential for global collaboration to impact health outcomes positively.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post-9/11 and 26/11 attacks, security measures at US airports and Indian hotels became stringent, normalizing privacy sacrifices for safety. The COVID-19 crisis demands similar privacy compromises for health surveillance, potentially resetting our privacy expectations permanently, but we must resist normalizing this intrusion post-crisis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Supreme Court of India ruled that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has the authority to regulate virtual currencies but found its decision to ban regulated entities from providing services to virtual currency exchanges disproportionate. The ruling clears the way for RBI to issue specific regulations on cryptocurrencies, likely more stringent than those in other countries, recognizing the potential stronger adverse effects on India&amp;rsquo;s developing economy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing vaccines is expensive, risky, and time-consuming due to stringent approval processes and logistical challenges. Platform technologies for vaccines, which can be adapted quickly for different pathogens, offer a promising solution. However, current legal regimes are not equipped to evaluate these platforms, and regulators must gain experience with them to accelerate approvals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The use of end-to-end encryption is essential for privacy but also poses challenges, as it can be misused for criminal activities, such as the distribution of Child Sexual Abuse Imagery (CSAI). The paper presented at the Web Conference 2019 highlights the exponential growth in CSAI, correlating it with technological advancements. The dilemma lies in finding a balance between protecting civil liberties through encryption and preventing its exploitation for criminal purposes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In 1998, Indian private telecom companies faced bankruptcy due to a crippling fixed-fee license model. The government&amp;rsquo;s 1999 policy shift to a revenue-sharing model saved the sector. Now, with a Supreme Court ruling on unpaid license fees, the sector faces crisis again, requiring government intervention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s recent achievement of &amp;ldquo;quantum supremacy&amp;rdquo; has highlighted the urgency of commercializing quantum computing. Once viable, it will render current encryption methods obsolete, as quantum computers could easily defeat even the highest encryption. India must invest in quantum computing research and development to remain technologically relevant and independent in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While dystopian science fiction is increasingly becoming true given the growing stratification of society, and the widening gap between the rich and the poor, technology has greatly exacerbated these differences. As we build our digital public infrastructure we need to redesign these technologies to ensure equitable access and benefits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Supreme Court of India&amp;rsquo;s recent judgment on internet shutdowns was initially seen as a strong denouncement, but closer examination reveals it&amp;rsquo;s not an outright condemnation. While emphasizing that shutdowns must be reasonable and proportionate, the court did not elevate internet access to a fundamental right, nor did it provide a clear ruling on the constitutionality of internet shutdowns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By substituting wood with coal England to achieve a far higher energy utilization and lower the cost of manufacture of iron and steel, generating large amounts of ferrous products and bringing into the production process a level of industrialization that India could not. Since cotton was a valuable trade commodity, effort was invested into producing textiles, resulting in the discovery of new means of production that launched the industrial revolution. This resulted in a loss of demand for various other goods whose continued development would have increased the pace of technological innovation in India. It translated into the destruction of educational institutions that generated knowledge and reduced the patronage for scientific and technical inquiry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There were doubts as to whether Aadhaar would work because of India&amp;rsquo;s patchy infrastructure. It eventually went on to provide identity to many, but faced challenges like enrolment errors and biometric recognition issues. Because it was mandatory linked to various services, the Supreme Court moved to restrict private sector access - significantly constraining its ability to function as a tool of transformation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian judicial system is in dire need of reform, with cases piling up and delays becoming a norm. While some digital information exists, the system remains largely analog, lacking crucial metrics and insights. Agami, an organization supporting legal innovation, is working to build a repository for legal data sets, aiming to develop a cloud storage system for collecting, storing, and updating legal data. This project is seen as a first step towards using data to understand and address the inefficiencies in the Indian legal system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;British colonial India significantly advanced forensic science, driven by a narrative of native deceit. Techniques like graphology and serological analysis were developed as judicial reliance on forensics grew, due to distrust in native testimonies. This legacy persists in India&amp;rsquo;s criminal justice system, often prioritizing technology over fundamental rights, as seen in recent DNA data bank legislation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The argument that data localization will boost India&amp;rsquo;s AI competence is flawed. Simply storing data in-country doesn&amp;rsquo;t translate to AI development, as data structures are company-specific and insights are often non-transferable. Instead, focusing on building AI infrastructure, incentivizing researchers, and encouraging homegrown AI development with existing data is more effective for fostering AI prowess.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stripping away anonymity entirely from social media platforms will never ever be useful. Just because a few have taken advantage of online anonymity for nefarious purposes does not mean that everyone else should be denied the many benefits that technology platforms provide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Competition law is challenged by the unique dynamics of internet platforms, which prioritize growth and customer lock-in over short-term profits. These platforms often operate at a scale that traditional businesses can&amp;rsquo;t match, and their data advantage allows them to tailor services precisely. While this leads to better user experiences, it also results in a winner-takes-all dynamic, limiting customer choice. Regulating these platforms is complex, as breaking them up might deny consumers the benefits they offer, and traditional competition remedies may not be applicable to the digital market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The victory of 16-year-old Kyle “Bugha&amp;quot; Giersdorf in the Fortnite World Cup highlights the global rise of eSports, with millions of viewers and substantial prize money. Despite its popularity, the industry lacks a central governing body, leading to challenges such as player protection, betting, match-fixing, and potential substance abuse. There is a need for appropriate regulation, especially as eSports is poised to flourish in India.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A new framework for consent to ensure data privacy</title>
      <link>http://rahulmatthan.github.io/07/08/2019/a-new-framework-for-consent-to-ensure-data-privacy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The effectiveness of consent in protecting privacy is diminishing in our data-rich world. A study found that companies&amp;rsquo; privacy policies and actual data sharing practices are inconsistent, with technically sophisticated firms sharing less data. A digital consent framework, exemplified by India&amp;rsquo;s account aggregator system, could enhance privacy protection by allowing dynamic, informed consent, but it currently lacks features to fully ensure privacy, such as purpose limitation and data deletion upon consent revocation. Enhancements to this framework could restore faith in consent as a tool for privacy protection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s draft Personal Data Protection Bill has sparked debate over data localization, with the government insisting on processing personal data within the country. Unlike other nations that restrict data transfers, India has made localization the default, an approach seen as out of character with its global trade stance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regulating technology is challenging due to its rapid evolution, leading to a disjointed patchwork of rules. Governments often react to technology&amp;rsquo;s harmful impacts rather than proactively anticipating them. Regulatory entrepreneurship, where changing laws is part of the business strategy, complicates this further. To improve technology regulation, the government should focus on real objectives, adopt principle-based laws, and seek expertise from various fields. This approach would ensure more effective, adaptable, and comprehensive technology regulation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The economics of modern electricity requires huge power plants to be established at remote locations and be connected to our homes and offices through the grid, a network of transmission and distribution lines that ensures availability of electricity in our power sockets whenever we need it. This centralized model doesn’t contemplate storing energy. Instead it calls for 24/7 power generation, varying the amount of energy generated only by season and time of day based on the anticipated load.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The crash of Air France Flight 447 in 2009 highlights the dangers of over-reliance on automation in aviation. When the autopilot disengaged due to a malfunction, the pilots&amp;rsquo; lack of manual flying experience led to a fatal error. But counter-intuitively - rather than relying on human intervention we need to trust more in machines and building better systems to automate them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many prominent figures have warned of the dangers of uncontrolled AI development. Even so, skeptics argue that humans will always control machines. Modern AI lacks the ability to reason with &amp;ldquo;what if?&amp;rdquo; questions and counterfactual imagination, which are essential for human-like intelligence. Though machines are not yet at this level, I would urge caution in advancing AI towards these capabilities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Given the extensive surveillance efforts by the US and UK governments, as revealed by Edward Snowden, there has been a push for data localization laws in various countries. We need to question the effectiveness of mass data collection in preventing terrorism since the growing volume of data may render such efforts futile. At the same time we need to question the approach of data localization, given the difficulty in extracting actionable intelligence from vast amounts of information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Historically, privacy was a luxury for the wealthy, who could afford private spaces and crafted distinct social personas. As society&amp;rsquo;s economic well-being improved, privacy became a societal expectation. Today, however, the rise of data-driven businesses threatens this privacy. Since privacy is rooted in capitalist interests, its preservation now conflicts with the commercial benefits of exploiting personal data. To protect privacy, we must establish commercial disincentives that outweigh the financial benefits of exploiting personal data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kevin Kelly predicts the dawn of a third platform age, following the World Wide Web and social media, which will digitize the physical world. This new platform involves a network of cameras capturing and uploading visual data to create a multi-dimensional digital representation of the world. Interaction with this digital world will be through connected glasses, blending augmented reality with the physical world, transforming education and entertainment. To avoid repeating history where U.S. corporations dominated previous platforms, proactive involvement in developing this technology and setting standards, particularly in AI and digitization, is crucial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both Europe and India are looking to regulate e-commerce platforms. And while they have different approaches they agree on the need for an online dispute resolution process. As we build out these systems we should not just place a digital layer on top of existing dispute resolution methods. Instead we should take the opportunity to embed digital artefacts into the workflow that will conclusively establish whether contractual obligations have been performed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The draft e-commerce policy released by the Indian government has been criticized for its broad and potentially harmful approach. It controversially claims collective ownership of data generated in India, suggesting state management over individual data rights. The policy misunderstands key technologies like AI, overemphasizes network effects, and ventures into unrelated domains like social media and taxation. Overall, it shows a lack of understanding of the sector it aims to regulate, which is disappointing for a technologically advanced nation like India.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the past five years, the internet has seen the growth of large technology platforms in various sectors, leading to concerns about competition. Social media and aggregator platforms create a lock-in effect, where users and suppliers feel compelled to join popular platforms, leading to potential monopolies. Traditional competition law views monopolies as harmful, but these platforms challenge this view by improving consumer choice and service quality. However, this shift in market dynamics may harm smaller suppliers, suggesting a need for regulatory protection for these market participants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite a 2014 initiative by the ministry of law and justice that mandated pre-legislative consultation, in most instances the process is largely superficial. We need a more genuine and constructive engagement from both the government and stakeholders, emphasizing compromise and understanding. The government should actively facilitate pre-legislative consultation, evaluate competing suggestions, and align decisions with democratic values to ensure more meaningful participation in policy-making.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The public credit registry (PCR), a centralized credit information system, would improve data quality and help borrowers build reputational collateral. However, a PCR alone isn&amp;rsquo;t sufficient; lenders also need information on borrowers&amp;rsquo; financial assets. The Reserve Bank of India&amp;rsquo;s account aggregator infrastructure addresses this by allowing borrowers to share financial asset information securely and with consent. While this system limits data misuse, it requires robust legal frameworks to ensure data is used only for intended purposes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Algorithmic sentencing, using machine learning to assess recidivism risk, has demonstrated consistent outcomes. But is not without flaws, sometimes reflecting human biases. Despite imperfections, I believe algorithms can introduce objectivity and be fine-tuned to reduce biases, making them more reliable than human judgment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lok Sabha passed the Aadhaar Amendment Bill, aiming to facilitate the continued use of Aadhaar within constraints set by the Supreme Court. The bill emphasizes voluntary use, gives statutory legitimacy to offline verification, strengthens privacy provisions, and controversially allows the private sector to regain access to Aadhaar infrastructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the past 12,000 years, Earth&amp;rsquo;s circular orbit has provided stable temperatures, fostering the Holocene era, crucial for human development and agriculture. This unique period of warmth, longer than previous interglacials, is threatened by human-induced climate change, with CO2 levels exceeding safe limits. The transition to the Anthropocene era, marked by significant human impact, necessitates urgent global action on sustainability and emissions reduction, as highlighted in recent international agreements and commitments by various US entities, despite federal resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The modern internet has become centralized and controlled by a few powerful corporations, deviating from its original vision of an open and decentralized platform. Tim Berners-Lee, the founding father of the internet, is working on a project called Solid to restore power to users by allowing them to store personal information in personal data stores (PDS) under their control. That said, universally accepted standards for electronic consent and true social graph portability might be a more effective way to balance convenience and data protection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The draft Personal Data Protection Bill in India aims to protect children&amp;rsquo;s online privacy through age verification and parental consent. However, these measures raise concerns about the loss of internet anonymity and practical issues with the age threshold. The Bill&amp;rsquo;s approach may inadvertently expose children to privacy risks, including those stemming from well-intentioned parental actions, and fails to consider children&amp;rsquo;s ability to make decisions about their privacy before reaching the age of majority.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disruption always comes from where we least expect it. Lawyers exercise an iron grip over their profession. They determine who can practise law and how they should conduct their business. They organize themselves in bar councils that then determine how they can (and cannot) advertise and with whom they can share profits. If librarians had exerted the same sort of control over the organization of information as lawyers do over the business of the law, the modern internet might never have come to pass. Unless we lawyers can loosen the iron grip that we have over the business of law, the profession might never see the disruption that it needs and deserves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Justice Srikrishna Committee&amp;rsquo;s data protection framework aims to balance individual privacy with the growth of the digital economy, distinct from models in the US, EU, and China. But the committee missed opportunities to encourage de-identified data use and set impractical standards for anonymization. Concerns arise from the draft law&amp;rsquo;s definition of harm, potentially hindering AI and machine learning applications in social contexts by categorizing service denial based on evaluative decisions as harmful, which could restrict beneficial financial and social inclusion technologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Srikrishna Committee report on India&amp;rsquo;s new privacy framework has been criticized for seemingly granting the government latitude in state surveillance, including national security exemptions. While similar exemptions are common in global data protection laws, concerns arise from the report&amp;rsquo;s failure to address practical concerns and the draft Bill&amp;rsquo;s inability to hold the government accountable for privacy violations. The penalties, designed with private entities in mind, may leave government data fiduciaries without fear of consequence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Justice Srikrishna Committee&amp;rsquo;s report on data protection proposes a user-centric framework, emphasizing data portability and privacy by design. However, its approach to consent, applying product liability principles and creating a complex, multilayered consent framework, may be impractical and burdensome for businesses, particularly startups. These measures, while aiming to enhance privacy, could introduce additional friction for users and businesses, potentially exacerbating consent fatigue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian government is leveraging its authority over telecom operators to indirectly regulate entities like WhatsApp and mobile manufacturers, which are beyond its direct control in an attempt to combat issues like fake news and ensure compliance with Do Not Disturb regulations. This approach indicates a strategy to extend regulatory authority into areas beyond its statutory reach, potentially compelling entities to comply to maintain access to the Indian market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The growth of IoT, particularly in sectors like transportation, faces regulatory challenges in India. Current telecom regulations, including customer verification for SIMs and limits on M2M (machine-to-machine) SIMs, hinder IoT development. We need less burdensome alternatives, like data-only SIMs and automatic deactivation upon removal, to balance industry growth with security concerns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is the nature of innovation that the ideas that gain traction are those that offer direct, tangible benefits to users. Since most legal technologies solve client problems they benefit clients more than the lawyers who use them. Legal technologies are slow ideas that will not disrupt the profession. We need fast, disruptive ideas and all that we are getting is incremental improvements in efficiency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The US Supreme Court recemtly ruled that collecting cellphone location data without a warrant violated privacy. This case challenges the third-party doctrine, which states that shared personal information has reduced privacy expectations. The ruling highlights the difficulty of applying traditional legal principles to modern technology, particularly regarding data privacy. This case could guide Indian privacy law, emphasizing the need for clear legislative direction on data collection and privacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benjamin Day published The Sun which was the world&amp;rsquo;s first penny press newspaper that was entirely ad-supported. This gave rise to advertising as a means to support the cost of news. Warren and Brandeis defined the Right to Privacy which contributed to the decline of yellow journalism. We need a similar reconceptualisation of regulation today to address the menace of ad driven news.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force on 25 May, affecting entities worldwide that do business with EU citizens. While the regulation has stringent requirements for consent and high penalties for non-compliance, it may have unintended consequences. Large platforms can easily adapt, but smaller entities and start-ups may struggle with the complexity and cost of compliance, potentially leading to a consolidation towards large data platforms and a chilling effect on new ventures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are inherrent challenges of using autonomous weapons with human oversight - in particular the fact that human judgment becomes an &amp;ldquo;inconvenient impediment&amp;rdquo; to the speed of modern warfare. Future wars, especially in the cybernetic arena, may render human intervention meaningless - and that should raise ethical and practical concerns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The proliferation of smart devices offers convenience by automating and personalizing daily tasks, like brewing coffee when an alarm is switched off. Integrating these devices with AI-powered smart speakers enhances this automation, but raises privacy concerns as these systems collect detailed personal data. This data could revolutionize e-commerce by predicting and fulfilling consumer needs before they&amp;rsquo;re explicitly expressed, shifting from a shop-then-ship to a ship-then-shop model, but at the cost of increased surveillance and data collection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We should not create specific laws for new technologies when general legal principles will suffice. Recently, a government task force recommended applying existing legal provisions to AI, but this approach may not address AI&amp;rsquo;s unique aspects, such as personhood and liability in autonomous systems. The complexity of AI decisions, especially in impactful areas like criminal sentencing, necessitates a tailored regulatory framework that balances accuracy with explainability, challenging the notion of applying traditional legal principles to AI regulation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has banned regulated entities from providing services related to virtual currencies, citing concerns over consumer protection, market integrity, and money laundering. I question the necessity of this step, since the perceived anonymity of bitcoin transactions can be penetrated. What&amp;rsquo;s more, the ban may drive nefarious activities further underground, making them harder to detect. I suggest improving forensic skills might be a more effective approach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The internet, originally designed for data collection and surveillance, faces a credibility crisis due to its misuse for manipulating public opinion. Its origins trace back to Hollerith&amp;rsquo;s punch card tabulators, which evolved into a government surveillance tool. Despite historical protests against its potential for &amp;ldquo;computerized people manipulation,&amp;rdquo; the internet&amp;rsquo;s utility has consistently outweighed concerns, leading to its current indispensable status. Yet, recent scandals like Facebook-Cambridge Analytica highlight ongoing tensions between its benefits and the risks of data misuse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &amp;ldquo;backfire effect&amp;rdquo; is a cognitive bias that causes people to double down on their beliefs despite evidence to the contrary. This makes fake news hard to combat because it taps into regional cultural norms and beliefs, making it resonate deeply with its intended audience. The only effective remedy is to engage with fake news at a subliminal level, recognizing its impact on political views and opinions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While technology excels at reducing friction in services like transportation, finance, and shopping, excessive ease can lead to unintended consequences. Regulators face the challenge of balancing technological innovation with necessary legal friction to prevent harm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The circular economy is a regenerative model aimed at minimizing waste and making the most of resources which is in contrast to our current economic model that emphasizes consumption and planned obsolescence. India, with its cultural inclination towards reuse and recycling, has the opportunity to incorporate principles of the circular economy in various sectors like construction, agriculture, and urban mobility, and businesses can do the same into their operations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is value in large datasets that reveal statistically relevant insights - such as trends in fast food visits or sleep patterns. This is relevant to India&amp;rsquo;s growing data economy given the potential to use aggregated anonymous data to make informed decisions. We need to implement privacy by design, and for that organizations need to de-identify personal information to prevent potential harm if the data is lost or stolen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The evolution of internet access in India, from a single-user bulletin board service to the vast, decentralized web, mirrors a broader trend towards centralization in digital services. Despite the internet&amp;rsquo;s expansive possibilities, most users gravitate towards a few familiar sites. This centralization tendency is also evident in Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s blockchain technology, where mining pools&amp;rsquo; dominance challenges the decentralized ideal, highlighting the need for potential regulatory intervention or system redesign.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In early 1800s America, credit was based on personal familiarity. Lewis Tappan revolutionized this by selling credit ratings, leading to the birth of credit reporting agencies. Today, these agencies hold extensive personal data, influencing major life decisions. India, formulating its first privacy legislation, faces a similar choice: regulate data collectors or empower individuals to control their data usage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Algorithms in streaming services and e-book libraries curate content based on individual preferences, often with impressive accuracy. However, the downside to this is the eventual homogenization of content. By continually reinforcing original preferences, the algorithms can lead to a lack of diversity in the content presented. We need to seek out new and different content, recognizing that while algorithms are powerful tools, they have limitations. They are only as good as the data they&amp;rsquo;ve been trained on, and without regular updates to keep them fresh and relevant, they can become restrictive rather than expansive in their recommendations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Traditional market models, focusing on supply control of scarce commodities, are outdated for the internet age. Modern tech companies grow by enhancing user experience and creating demand-driven platforms. This self-perpetuating cycle benefits consumers, challenging the need for market fragmentation. Indian competition authorities should independently assess the best approach to truly benefit consumers, even if it diverges from global norms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Historically, false news has influenced major events, from anti-Semitic libels to the Spanish-American War. With the rise of social media, exposure to unregulated, biased news has increased, exploiting human tendencies like implicit and confirmation biases. This creates echo chambers, reinforcing beliefs without exposure to differing views. The evolution of fake news now includes realistic audio and potential video fabrications. Addressing this, technology, not regulation, might offer solutions, such as a &amp;ldquo;FactRank&amp;rdquo; algorithm to assess news accuracy, akin to Google&amp;rsquo;s PageRank for search results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Luddite movement, originating in the late 1700s with Ned Ludham&amp;rsquo;s act of industrial defiance, evolved into a labor movement focused on collective bargaining rather than a blanket opposition to technology. Today, as technological advancements rapidly replace human jobs, society faces the prospect of a post-work future. This shift challenges traditional notions of work&amp;rsquo;s role in providing income and purpose, potentially leading to a society sustained by systems like Universal Basic Income and a reevaluation of life&amp;rsquo;s meaning beyond work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We rely on technology for daily tasks - from timely reminders to personalized entertainment suggestions. While this personalization offers convenience and informed decision-making, it raises privacy concerns. The proposed privacy law shifts responsibility from individual consent to data controllers, ensuring no harm from data processing. This includes financial, reputational, or choice-related harms, especially from biased machine learning algorithms. The law suggests regular data audits by learned intermediaries, moving towards privacy compliance through incentives rather than penalties.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darwin&amp;rsquo;s theory of natural selection inspired Francis Galton to propose eugenics, the idea that selective breeding could enhance human traits. This concept gained traction in the early 20th century, leading to sterilization laws in the U.S. and Nazi Germany&amp;rsquo;s racial hygiene program. These ideas eventually culminated in the Holocaust, where six million Jews were killed. Today, the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to alter genes offers a new frontier in genetics, with the lessons of the past serving as a cautionary reminder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Supreme Court of India&amp;rsquo;s ban on liquor sales along highways led to the closure of bars and pubs on Bengaluru&amp;rsquo;s MG Road and Brigade Road, mistakenly identified as part of NH-4 and NH-7. The excise department&amp;rsquo;s order, based on outdated map information, ignored the city&amp;rsquo;s changed highway network, reflecting a broader issue with government map coordination.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Music&amp;rsquo;s evolution from live performances to digital streaming has been shaped by technology, expanding audience reach but often at the cost of artist revenue. With the advent of blockchain-based services like Musicoin, artists can now bypass traditional intermediaries, offering direct access to their music and potentially transforming the industry&amp;rsquo;s revenue model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The marketplace has always been a battleground between buyers and sellers. With industrialization, sellers gained an information advantage, leading governments to implement regulations like maximum retail price (MRP) to protect consumers. E-commerce has shifted the balance, offering consumers more price transparency and forcing sellers to adapt. Online shopping leaves a digital trail, allowing sellers to gain insights into consumer behavior and price sensitivity. Sophisticated algorithms are now being developed to achieve &amp;ldquo;perfect price discrimination,&amp;rdquo; where each buyer pays exactly what they perceive a product is worth. In this new paradigm, traditional concepts like MRP may become redundant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the use of biometrics like fingerprints and iris scans for identity raises concerns about personal privacy, facial recognition poses a far greater threat. Unlike other biometrics, faces are easily captured, and the lack of regulation and rapid advancement of technology expose individuals to the risk of active surveillance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In &amp;ldquo;Homo Deus&amp;rdquo;, Yuval Noah Harari suggests that Homo sapiens&amp;rsquo; success is due to our unique ability to believe in myths, like nation-states, which unite individuals under a common identity. This concept is crucial in modern society, where identity systems like India&amp;rsquo;s Aadhaar balance social responsibilities with personal privacy, highlighting the need for privacy laws to maintain this equilibrium.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need to question the concept of &amp;ldquo;average&amp;rdquo; human medical standards, such as body temperature given the extent of the individual variations in human biology. There is a need for personalized medical treatment particularly when one considers how wearable technologies could revolutionize healthcare by enabling continuous monitoring and customized care.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the 19th century, London faced the Great Manure Crisis, a seemingly insurmountable urban catastrophe. The advent of automobiles resolved the issue within a decade. Might we dare to imaging that the global pollution crisis, might have a similar, as yet unknown technological solutions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian government&amp;rsquo;s recent mandate to link Aadhaar numbers with tax returns and mobile numbers highlights the urgent need for a privacy law. Current proposals suggest a law based on OECD principles, emphasizing consent. However, given the complexity of data use today, the responsibility should shift from individual consent to holding data controllers accountable, ensuring fair and non-discriminatory data processing. India has the chance to create a forward-thinking privacy framework suitable for today&amp;rsquo;s data-intensive world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The story of chess and rice illustrates exponential growth, paralleled in technology and genetics. Moore&amp;rsquo;s Law on computing power doubling every two years has led to advanced AI, machine learning, and virtual reality. Similarly, rapid advancements in genetics, outpacing Moore&amp;rsquo;s Law, are revolutionizing disease diagnosis and treatment, potentially transforming industries like insurance by redefining pre-existing conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Law firms struggle with partner compensation models, balancing profit and collaboration. The &amp;ldquo;eat-what-you-kill&amp;rdquo; model, based on individual revenue generation, can lead to competition and reduced cooperation. In contrast, the lockstep system, rewarding tenure over performance, may not fully incentivize productivity. Similar challenges exist in finance, where hedge funds guard proprietary data. Numerai, an AI firm, addresses this by using homomorphic encryption and a public platform, allowing data scientists to contribute to a meta-model, democratizing data without compromising confidentiality, and rewarding contributions with bitcoin. This innovative approach could inspire similar solutions in the legal industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lawmaking, fraught with the challenge of foreseeing unintended consequences, often leads to statutes filled with broad, catch-all provisions. These residuary clauses, while providing regulatory flexibility, create uncertainty and potential for overreach. The Other Service Providers (OSPs) regulations in telecom exemplify this, with vague definitions extending regulatory reach to unintended sectors. Precise, purpose-built legislation is advocated over open-ended definitions to avoid such regulatory ambiguities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Early e-commerce companies in India had to create their own infrastructure, leading to the development of advanced logistics services within cities. However, inter-state transport has not seen the same technological transformation, largely due to regulatory constraints. Revisiting these regulations could lead to significant improvements in the national transportation infrastructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a world rejecting globalization, the critical role of synchronized time, essential for modern civilization, is often overlooked. Medieval Europe&amp;rsquo;s independent timekeeping evolved with industrialization, requiring precise coordination. Today, technologies like mobile networks, electricity grids, and GPS rely on exact time synchronization. GPS, a US Department of Defense system, underpins these technologies, highlighting the interconnectedness of global systems amidst rising nationalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Auto rickshaw drivers often charge more than the metered fare in response to market dynamics, similar to surge pricing in ride-hailing apps. This raises competition law concerns, as algorithm-driven pricing could lead to unintentional collusion, setting higher equilibrium prices. The challenge for regulators is to adapt antitrust laws to address potential collusion by autonomous algorithms, which can independently develop strategies for profit maximization, including tacit collusion, without overt intent or agreement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian government&amp;rsquo;s approach to using imprecise language in law-making - particularly in technology regulation - can lead to unintended consequences. If we can use regulatory &amp;ldquo;sandboxes&amp;rdquo; to safely test new technologies to be tested within controlled environments it would foster innovation and create more precise and effective regulations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those with rare diseases face tremendous challenges given that pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to produce the necessary drugs, and the high costs often make treatment unaffordable. Karnataka became the first state to release a Rare Diseases and Orphan Drugs Policy, recommending preventive testing, education, tax breaks, and insurance coverage for rare diseases. If other states follow suit, it could offer hope for those like Mohammed to lead longer and more dignified lives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statistician Fredrick Hoffman, known for identifying health risks like asbestos and tobacco, is also remembered for his flawed 1896 study claiming African Americans were inherently sicker than whites. This study, influenced by prejudice, had lasting negative impacts. As we increasingly rely on data and predictive algorithms, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to avoid such biases and ensure fair, accurate interpretations to prevent perpetuating discrimination and injustice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian government insists on using the Everest Spheroid as the reference datum for its maps, citing greater accuracy and military significance. However, with the development of the World Geodetic System, which uses the Earth&amp;rsquo;s center of mass, the government&amp;rsquo;s insistence on surface reference mapping and restrictions on map exportation appears outdated and unnecessary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2016 was a transformative year, marked by the e-commerce sector&amp;rsquo;s challenges following the Indian government&amp;rsquo;s Press Note 3. This led to innovative business models and growth in related industries like logistics and warehousing. The year also saw Aadhaar enrolment surpass 1 billion, laying the foundation for India&amp;rsquo;s digital transformation. The introduction of India Stack, particularly the Unified Payment Interface (UPI), revolutionized digital payments. However, the focus shifted towards including the larger, underserved population in the digital economy, highlighting the need for a balanced policy framework that respects privacy while leveraging data-driven decision-making.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wearable devices are increasingly common, tracking various physical activities and even finding their way into legal evidence. The future of medicine may lie in this quantified personal measurement, allowing for customized treatment tailored to individual patients. However, to reach this future, changes to regulatory frameworks and a rethinking of privacy notions are needed to allow for more patient-centric medical treatment and algorithmic diagnosis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Delhi high court&amp;rsquo;s decision allowing photocopying of textbooks for educational purposes has been praised for its modern interpretation of copyright law. The ruling emphasizes the need to adapt copyright law to contemporary realities, including the rise of digital content and remix culture, where traditional copyright may hinder creativity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India has the potential to use data innovatively for enhancing healthcare outcomes. However, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to balance patient privacy with public good, defining clear grounds for data access and stringent punishments for misuse. The draft EHR legislation suggests patients &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; their medical data, but a nuanced approach focusing on access and control is needed. India has a unique opportunity to leverage technology for healthcare, but must strike the right balance between personal privacy and public good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social media news algorithms represent the future of news dissemination. However, the need for personalization, driven by advertising revenue, creates &amp;lsquo;filter bubbles&amp;rsquo;, limiting our exposure to a diversity of information sources. We need to implement software oversight: open-source algorithms auditing newsfeeds for bias, maintaining algorithm secrecy while ensuring objectivity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The history of copyright reflects the struggle of artists to reach audiences, from direct personal interfaces to the printing press and the Internet. Despite the symbiotic relationship between artists and publishers, the Internet has allowed artists to directly access audiences. Recent amendments to India&amp;rsquo;s Copyright Act and government clarifications have further extended the scope to Internet broadcasting companies, potentially unlocking vast music catalogues, though the direct benefit to artists remains unclear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data is a critical capital asset, driving major business transformations. Industries from retail to transportation are adopting data-driven strategies, with sensor technology and analytics optimizing performance and service. Governments are recognizing data&amp;rsquo;s value in smart city development and predictive policing, suggesting a future where data not only informs decisions but also automates regulatory compliance, potentially revolutionizing governance and business operations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite the potential benefits of digital payments, its widespread adoption in India is faced with numerous challenges. The real bottleneck is merchant acceptance, hindered by transaction costs and lack of infrastructure. The Unified Payment Interface (UPI) offers hope, integrating with Aadhaar for secure transactions and potentially lower costs, but success hinges on merchant adoption and regulatory support, shifting focus from consumer to merchant-centric solutions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the introduction of Aadhaar, the concept of anonymity on the Internet has been diminishing in India. While this shift has benefits, it contrasts with the continued presence of anonymous trolls online. Embracing verified accounts could restore normalcy and trust on the Internet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Where Did Our Map Regulations Come From</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s map regulations impose restrictions on the cross-border transfer of maps or map data - despite the global shift to cloud-based consumption. I investigate the origins of these arcane regulations to try and figure out how they came about and what can be done to set it right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While Press Note 3 of 2016, was supposed to liberalise FDI in e-commerce in India, it is filled with contradictory provisions and unclear definitions - particularly regarding the inclusion of service and digital product sales in e-commerce. It is, in fact, a step back and is reflective of the fact that the government&amp;rsquo;s understanding of technology and its impact is inadequate. Effective regulation in the Network Age requires precise, flexible legislation, understanding network patterns, and a non-linear approach to policy formulation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consumption is one of the cornerstones of capitalism and modern society actively encourages it. Planned obsolescence feeds this philosophy by making a placing time limits on technology to make it stop functioning so that replacements can be purchased. If we prioritise access over ownership utilization will increase and products will no longer have to be made obsolete to encourage greater consumption.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a transformation in the dissemination of news now that it takes place through social media platforms and smartphones. As a result user-generated content has started to shape modern journalism. As a result there is a shift in the role of social media companies that raises new questions about the protection and support for this new form of citizen journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s distributed ledger technology offers a solution to the trust issue in online transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries in e-commerce. This blockchain concept can extend beyond currency, revolutionizing contracts, intellectual property rights, and public records by ensuring tamper-resistant, verifiable transactions. Governments could adopt this technology for more efficient, accountable public services, as seen in Rajasthan&amp;rsquo;s state-guaranteed land titles, potentially paving the way for blockchain governance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The University of Oxford&amp;rsquo;s study revealed that 47% of jobs today could be replaced by computers, including cognitive and evaluative roles. While lawyers have a low risk of displacement, paralegals and legal assistants face a 94% chance of being replaced. The rise of AI in law could disrupt traditional apprenticeship models and requires the legal industry to reorganize before technology claims their livelihood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The consent-based model of data protection is outdated and ineffective in the modern, interconnected world. We need to shift from focusing on obtaining consent to holding organizations accountable for the data they control. India, lacking a formal privacy law, has a unique opportunity to develop a modern privacy law centered on accountability, which could serve as a model for the rest of the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drones are likely to be flown in urban areas and so instead of being regulated by the DGCA they should be regulated by the police that can address the traffic management and privacy violation issues that are likely to be the consequence of their use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need to develop the ethical frameworks within which vehicle manufacturers should operate or else they will ensure that the parameters on which autonomous vehicles are regulated serve their own interests. Autonomous vehicles should not have to comply with laws designed for vehicles are driven by humans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On-demand services that comprise the sharing economy are superior to their real world counterparts because of the dual feedback system. Trust identity based on dual feedback loops loops could create the civilised commercial ecosystem that has always been the ultimate objective of putting in place a regulatory framework.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The provisions of the proposed Geospatial Bill should be no surprise as these obligations have formed part of the map policy that has existed for a very long time. But thanks to the government&amp;rsquo;s approach of being outwardly strict in legislation but practically benevolent in enforcement our map ecosystem has flourished.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While it is not without its flaws, a closer examination of the provisions of the Aadhaar Act will make it clear that it imposes on the government, some of the strongest fetters on executive over-reach of any legislation in the country.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
