This system raises concerns about data accuracy and the impact of false information on individuals&amp;rsquo; lives. As other countries might adopt similar systems, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to ensure these algorithms are fair and continually reassess their trust evaluations to avoid unjust consequences.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trust works two ways</title><link>https://exmachina.in/08/11/2017/trust-works-two-ways/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exmachina.in/08/11/2017/trust-works-two-ways/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>The increasing reliance on social ratings and feedback loops in services like ride-sharing platforms is leading to a system where personal ratings may determine access to services. This trend, mirrored in China&amp;rsquo;s proposed national trust score, raises concerns about algorithmic discrimination and its societal impact.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>False confidence</title><link>https://exmachina.in/20/09/2017/false-confidence/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exmachina.in/20/09/2017/false-confidence/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>As reliance on electronic systems grows, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to ensure accurate user identification. Authentication protocols should use permanent, non-reusable IDs, expanding digits if necessary. We must build robust systems that are error-resistant to match the increasing trust we place in them.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trusting the Sharing Economy</title><link>https://exmachina.in/08/06/2016/trusting-the-sharing-economy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exmachina.in/08/06/2016/trusting-the-sharing-economy/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>On-demand services that comprise the sharing economy are superior to their real world counterparts because of the dual feedback system. Trust identity based on dual feedback loops loops could create the civilised commercial ecosystem that has always been the ultimate objective of putting in place a regulatory framework.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
