      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are potentially on the verge of momentous change. Artificial intelligence has improved to the point where it could pass as human.

While we must not expect the skill of the past to continue to be useful we should guard against trusting technology blindly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
