      <description>Over the course of my career, I have come across entrepreneurs of all hues.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technology has democratised distribution of content allowing a more direct connection between artists and their audience. New amendments in India&amp;rsquo;s copyright laws have taken this even further ensuring that creative works are even more accessible than they have ever been.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
