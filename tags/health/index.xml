This is futile as in most instances any harms that may be caused by technology is on account of how it is used and by whom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With digital public infrastructure India is, perhaps for the first time, making the rules. It is time for us to stop being rule-takers and assume the role of rule-makers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bacteriophages target specific bacterial cells and destroy them leaving all other cells unharmed. These organisms have been used for phage therapy - a treatment for disease that involves administering the specific bacteriophage corresponding to a given bacterial infection in order to treat it. Now that the continuous use of broad spectrum antibiotics has resulted in superbugs with high levels of antibiotic resistance, phage therapy might be the precision medicine solution that we need. This will require us to overhaul our current thinking about pharmaceuticals and adopt more localised manufacture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/23/06/2021/patient-capital/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breakthroughs in science require patient capital that must be provided by the government. Scientists need to be given a long rope and not be held to the standards of accountability to which we typically hold the government. They need to have bipartisan [[political support]] as they operate at time-scales beyond that which politicians normally function within. They need pipelines to market that will allow these ideas to be naturally commercialised.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/18/05/2021/the-rural-challenge/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need different protocols to deal with the pandemic in rural India. Instead of supplying oxygen we need to provide them with a supply of medicines and basic equipment they need. Since it is not feasible to get RTPCR tests done in a reasonable time frame we need to replace that with syndromic testing using oximeters and thermometers. And we need to leverage our decentralised healthcare networks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/04/05/2021/the-vaccine-waiver/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Given the urgency to vaccinate the world there is an urgent need to ramp up production of vaccines. All that is coming in the way of that is the intellectual property rights over vaccine recipes. What is required is a temporary vaccine waiver of intellectual property rights in order to encourage worldwide manufacture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/28/04/2021/vaccinate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We must combat vaccine hesitancy and get everyone vaccinated against covid-19. The only strategy to survive in India is to not get infected or to get fully vaccinated. The risk of blood clots is insignificant compared to the risk of getting the disease.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Karanveer Singh has Duchenne&amp;rsquo;s Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). His family has discovered an experimental therapy that skips the missing exon in the DMD gene, allowing dystrophin production. Despite bureaucratic obstacles, the Central Licensing Authority permitted a clinical trial across India. If successful, the treatment, developed by the Dystrophy Annihilation Research Trust (DART), will be available at a fraction of the cost of Western alternatives, offering hope to thousands of families.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Digital Health Mission&amp;rsquo;s Strategy Overview outlines India&amp;rsquo;s plan to become a Digital Health Nation, leveraging the nascent state of healthcare digitization to learn from other countries and avoid their mistakes. The strategy involves adapting India&amp;rsquo;s data portability architecture, using the Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) for healthcare data sharing. It proposes a radically-federated design, storing healthcare data at its generation point and enabling rapid data transfer across the health system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As countries grapple with COVID-19&amp;rsquo;s community spread phase, the focus has shifted to frequent testing. It is time to consider the potential use of health and immunity passports. These passports could become essential for travel and social activities, but at the same time give rise to a greater risk of deepening social divides and creating new forms of privilege.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During India&amp;rsquo;s fifth week of lockdown, measures have slowed COVID-19&amp;rsquo;s spread, despite testing and reporting concerns. A staggered lifting of restrictions is planned, balancing disease control with economic needs. Utilizing mobility data can guide reopening strategies, but privacy concerns must be addressed, especially in less dense areas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of global supply chains and our over-reliance on just-in-time delivery models. While some may argue for more insular approaches and increased governmental control, the free movement of data and international collaboration has enabled rapid responses, such as genome sequencing and 3D printing of medical equipment. The crisis highlights the potential for global collaboration to impact health outcomes positively.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;British colonial India significantly advanced forensic science, driven by a narrative of native deceit. Techniques like graphology and serological analysis were developed as judicial reliance on forensics grew, due to distrust in native testimonies. This legacy persists in India&amp;rsquo;s criminal justice system, often prioritizing technology over fundamental rights, as seen in recent DNA data bank legislation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Delhi High court has held that rejecting an insurance claim on the grounds of the genetic conditions exclusion issued by the IRDAI would be violative of violative of Article 14 since discrimination on the basis of genetic heritage is unconstitutional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Individuals generate vast amounts of medical data through various healthcare interactions and personal devices. Machine learning can unlock proactive diagnoses, but current data silos and over-protective attitudes hinder access and sharing. A proposed electronic data request framework in India aims to place control with the data subject, enabling personal analysis and broader applications, such as credit-worthiness assessments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darwin&amp;rsquo;s theory of natural selection inspired Francis Galton to propose eugenics, the idea that selective breeding could enhance human traits. This concept gained traction in the early 20th century, leading to sterilization laws in the U.S. and Nazi Germany&amp;rsquo;s racial hygiene program. These ideas eventually culminated in the Holocaust, where six million Jews were killed. Today, the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to alter genes offers a new frontier in genetics, with the lessons of the past serving as a cautionary reminder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dengue, that affects millions annually, may be mitigated by using Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. This approach, along with fecal microbiota transplants for C-diff infections, underscores a shift towards microbiome-focused therapies. Future medicine may rely on synthetic biology for precise, customized treatments, challenging current regulatory frameworks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need to question the concept of &amp;ldquo;average&amp;rdquo; human medical standards, such as body temperature given the extent of the individual variations in human biology. There is a need for personalized medical treatment particularly when one considers how wearable technologies could revolutionize healthcare by enabling continuous monitoring and customized care.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are ethical and legal complexities with treating terminally ill patients in India. There is a thin and grey line between palliative care and assisted suicide. We need clear legislation regarding living wills and the right to die with dignity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The story of chess and rice illustrates exponential growth, paralleled in technology and genetics. Moore&amp;rsquo;s Law on computing power doubling every two years has led to advanced AI, machine learning, and virtual reality. Similarly, rapid advancements in genetics, outpacing Moore&amp;rsquo;s Law, are revolutionizing disease diagnosis and treatment, potentially transforming industries like insurance by redefining pre-existing conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those with rare diseases face tremendous challenges given that pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to produce the necessary drugs, and the high costs often make treatment unaffordable. Karnataka became the first state to release a Rare Diseases and Orphan Drugs Policy, recommending preventive testing, education, tax breaks, and insurance coverage for rare diseases. If other states follow suit, it could offer hope for those like Mohammed to lead longer and more dignified lives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statistician Fredrick Hoffman, known for identifying health risks like asbestos and tobacco, is also remembered for his flawed 1896 study claiming African Americans were inherently sicker than whites. This study, influenced by prejudice, had lasting negative impacts. As we increasingly rely on data and predictive algorithms, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to avoid such biases and ensure fair, accurate interpretations to prevent perpetuating discrimination and injustice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene-editing breakthrough that promises cures for genetic diseases but raises ethical concerns about creating &amp;ldquo;designer babies&amp;rdquo; and potential misuse. While some advocate for a moratorium on germ-line modifications, others argue for its therapeutic potential, especially in eradicating devastating genetic disorders like Tay-Sachs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India has the potential to use data innovatively for enhancing healthcare outcomes. However, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to balance patient privacy with public good, defining clear grounds for data access and stringent punishments for misuse. The draft EHR legislation suggests patients &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; their medical data, but a nuanced approach focusing on access and control is needed. India has a unique opportunity to leverage technology for healthcare, but must strike the right balance between personal privacy and public good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
