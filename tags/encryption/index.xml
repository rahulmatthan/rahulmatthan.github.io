For those services that are end-to-end encrypted complying with this obligation will mean that they can no longer guarantee the anonymity of the parties. By asking message originators to be identified, it requires every single message to be tracked. In trying to identify a fewÂ criminals, it makes criminals of us all.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prepare for a world of quantum haves and have-nots</title><link>https://exmachina.in/05/02/2020/prepare-for-a-world-of-quantum-haves-and-have-nots/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exmachina.in/05/02/2020/prepare-for-a-world-of-quantum-haves-and-have-nots/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Google&amp;rsquo;s recent achievement of &amp;ldquo;quantum supremacy&amp;rdquo; has highlighted the urgency of commercializing quantum computing. Once viable, it will render current encryption methods obsolete, as quantum computers could easily defeat even the highest encryption. India must invest in quantum computing research and development to remain technologically relevant and independent in the future.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
